- ❌ `ANDROID_STUDIO_QUICKSTART.md`
- ❌ `ANDROID_STUDIO_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- ❌ `ANDROID_STUDIO_SUMMARY.md`

## ✅ Use This Instead

**→ `ANDROID_STUDIO_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`**

This new comprehensive guide includes:
1. Quick Start (5 min)
2. First-Time Setup
3. Opening the Project
4. Building the App
5. Signing for Release
6. Deployment Options
7. Troubleshooting
8. Project Structure
9. Common Tasks

## Why Consolidate?

**Before:** 6 overlapping docs with duplicate information  
**After:** 1 comprehensive guide with clear sections

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Better organized
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Faster to find information
- ✅ No conflicting instructions

## Old Files

The old files are kept for reference but should not be used for new work.
